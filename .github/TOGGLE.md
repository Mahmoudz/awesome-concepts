3. A dialog box should appear. Enter anything in the name field, example 'Awesome Toggles'.
4. Paste this safe JS code into the URL field.
    ```javascript
    javascript:(function(){document.querySelectorAll('details > summary > strong').forEach(strong => { if (strong.textContent.trim().length > 0) { strong.closest('details').open = true; }});})();
    ```
5. Save the new bookmark. That's it!
