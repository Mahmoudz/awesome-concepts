<details><summary><strong>Adapter Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Adapter design pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Decorator Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Decorator design pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is useful for extending the functionality of classes.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Proxy Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Proxy design pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used for various purposes, such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Observer Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is commonly used in event handling and UI updates.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Command Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Command design pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It is used to decouple sender and receiver objects.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows clients to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Chain Of Responsibility Pattern</strong></summary><p>

> The Chain of Responsibility design pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. It is used for achieving loose coupling of senders and receivers.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Idempotency</strong></summary><p>

> Idempotency means that an operation or function, when applied multiple times, has the same result as if it were applied once. In the context of APIs, marking an operation as idempotent ensures that even if the same request is sent multiple times, it has the same effect as if it were sent once. This prevents unintended side effects and ensures data consistency.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Concurrency</strong></summary><p>

> Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It's important for designing efficient software that can make the most of modern multi-core processors.

> Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates the handling of commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) in a system. It allows for optimizing and scaling the two types of operations independently, improving system performance and maintainability.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Event Sourcing</strong></summary><p>

> Event Sourcing is a design pattern that involves capturing all changes to an application's state as a series of immutable events. It provides a comprehensive history of actions and enables features like auditing, debugging, and state reconstruction in software systems.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong></summary><p>

> Eventual Consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems, where it is acknowledged that, given time and certain conditions, all replicas of data will eventually become consistent. It is a key consideration in designing highly available distributed systems.
