## Software Design
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<details>
    <summary><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong></summary>
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. It promotes modularity, reusability, and a clear organization of code.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Inheritance</strong></summary>
    Inheritance is a concept in OOP where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It promotes code reuse and hierarchy in class relationships.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Polymorphism</strong></summary>
    Polymorphism is a design principle in OOP where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior based on the actual object's type.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Composition</strong></summary>
    Composition is a design principle in OOP where objects of one class can be composed of objects of another class. It promotes building complex objects by combining simpler ones.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Aggregation</strong></summary>
    Aggregation is a form of association in OOP where one class contains references to other classes as part of its structure. It represents a "has-a" relationship between objects.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Abstraction</strong></summary>
    Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential details while hiding unnecessary complexities. It allows developers to work with high-level concepts without dealing with low-level implementation details.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Encapsulation</strong></summary>
    Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It helps in data hiding and maintaining data integrity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>SOLID Principles</strong></summary>
    SOLID is an acronym representing five principles of object-oriented design: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles help create modular and maintainable software.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong></summary>
    The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the SOLID principles in software design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility or function within the system.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong></summary>
    The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is another SOLID principle that encourages software entities to be open for extension but closed for modification. It promotes the use of abstract classes and interfaces to allow for new functionality without changing existing code.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</strong></summary>
    The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a SOLID principle that states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. It ensures that inheritance hierarchies maintain the expected behaviors.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</strong></summary>
    The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is another SOLID principle that suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It encourages the creation of specific, client-focused interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</strong></summary>
    The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is the last of the SOLID principles, and it promotes decoupling between high-level modules and low-level modules by introducing abstractions and inverting the direction of dependencies. It encourages the use of interfaces and abstract classes to achieve flexibility and maintainability.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Coupling</strong></summary>
    Coupling in software design refers to the degree of interdependence between modules or components within a system. Low coupling indicates that modules are loosely connected and can be modified independently. High coupling suggests strong dependencies and can lead to reduced flexibility and maintainability.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Cohesion</strong></summary>
    Cohesion in software design refers to the degree to which elements within a module or component are related to one another. High cohesion implies that the elements within a module are closely related in function and work together to achieve a specific purpose. It leads to more readable, maintainable, and understandable code.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Design Patterns</strong></summary>
    Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to solving specific design challenges and promoting maintainability and extensibility.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Builder Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Builder design pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing for the creation of different variations of the same object.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Factory Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling and flexibility in object creation.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used for managing resources, configuration settings, or a single point of control.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Adapter Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Adapter design pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Decorator Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Decorator design pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is useful for extending the functionality of classes.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Proxy Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Proxy design pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used for various purposes, such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Observer Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is commonly used in event handling and UI updates.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Command Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Command design pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It is used to decouple sender and receiver objects.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows clients to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime, promoting flexibility and maintainability.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Chain Of Responsibility Pattern</strong></summary>
    The Chain of Responsibility design pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. It is used for achieving loose coupling of senders and receivers.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Idempotency</strong></summary>
    Idempotency means that an operation or function, when applied multiple times, has the same result as if it were applied once. In the context of APIs, marking an operation as idempotent ensures that even if the same request is sent multiple times, it has the same effect as if it were sent once. This prevents unintended side effects and ensures data consistency.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Concurrency</strong></summary>
    Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It's important for designing efficient software that can make the most of modern multi-core processors.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</strong></summary>
    Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an architectural and design approach that focuses on modeling a software system based on the domain it operates within. It emphasizes a shared understanding between domain experts and developers, resulting in a more effective and maintainable design.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</strong></summary>
    Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates the handling of commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) in a system. It allows for optimizing and scaling the two types of operations independently, improving system performance and maintainability.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Event Sourcing</strong></summary>
    Event Sourcing is a design pattern that involves capturing all changes to an application's state as a series of immutable events. It provides a comprehensive history of actions and enables features like auditing, debugging, and state reconstruction in software systems.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong></summary>
    Eventual Consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems, where it is acknowledged that, given time and certain conditions, all replicas of data will eventually become consistent. It is a key consideration in designing highly available distributed systems.
